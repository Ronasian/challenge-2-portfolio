        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Ronan Sanchez. I am 25 years old and I'm an aspiring software engineer. 
          I've come a long way in my coding journey, and am eager to learn everything I can to become 
          an exceptional programmer. I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp through UC Davis. 
          As of now, my greatest strength when it comes to coding is logical thinking and problem solving, 
          which is why I find working with Javascript to be a fun challenge. I hope the opportunity to 
          show my skills in a professional work environment comes my way, but for now, feel free to browse 
          through the projects provided in my very own portfolio! This webpage is currently a work in
          progress. My submission will be graded on it's functionality, structure, and the neccessary elements
          according to the assignment's description. The following apps below are mini projects from my bootcamp,
          and more or less acts as placeholders for future projects, as I will be updating it throughout the course
          of my learning. Reguardless, the work I displayed on this site are my first
          websites I have ever made, and I am satisfied with them. They will forever be a reminder of where I started,
          and will show me how far I have come in my coding journey!
